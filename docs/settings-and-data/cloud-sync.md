# Cloud Sync

Keep your study materials synchronized across all your devices seamlessly.

## How Cloud Sync Works

### Automatic Synchronization
Changes you make on one device are automatically:
1. Uploaded to Brainy's servers
2. Downloaded to your other devices
3. Merged with your local data

This ensures your study progress stays current across all devices.

## Getting Started with Sync

### Email Verification
Before using sync:
1. Set up an account and log in
2. Verify your email address via the verification code that you can enter in the app
3. Sync functionality becomes available

### Enable Auto-Sync
In **Settings**, enable these options for automatic synchronization: **Sync on Startup and on close** — Sync when you open the app and when you close the app.

## Sync Conflict Resolution

### Last-Write-Wins Strategy
If you modify the same card on two devices before they sync:
- The version with the most recent timestamp wins
- Earlier changes are overwritten
- Example: If you edit a card on your phone, then your laptop (without syncing first), the laptop's version becomes the official version

**Best Practice:** Sync frequently to avoid accidental data loss.

## Storage Limits

### Maximum Storage
- **100 MB** total storage for all synced items
- This includes all files, cards, and metadata
- Sufficient for most users with thousands of cards

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
