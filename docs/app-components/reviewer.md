# Reviewer

The **Reviewer** is where you study your cards using scientifically-optimized spaced repetition powered by [FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler)](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition).

## Review Process

### Study a Card
1. A card appears with some information hidden to challenge your recall
2. Try to remember the answer from memory
3. Click **Show Answer** to reveal the correct answer
4. If you give up, you can also click **Show Answer** at any time

### Rate Your Performance
After revealing the answer, choose how difficult it was to remember:

| Rating | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| **Again** (1) | You completely forgot or got it wrong |
| **Hard** (2) | You remembered but with significant effort |
| **Good** (3) | You remembered with reasonable ease |
| **Easy** (4) | You remembered instantly and effortlessly |

### Next Review Time
Each button shows when you'll see this card again:
- **Again** — Usually within days (for cards you need more practice with)
- **Hard** — Longer interval (you're getting there)
- **Good** — Even longer interval (you've mostly mastered it)
- **Easy** — Longest interval (you know this well)

## Editing During Review
Click the **Edit** button to jump directly to the card's editor if you need to:
- Correct an error
- Update the card content
- Add clarifications

Your changes are saved immediately when you return to review.
