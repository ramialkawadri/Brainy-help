# Editor

The **Editor** is where you create and modify your study content. Files are organized into study blocks called **cells**, each of which can be reviewed multiple times on a customizable schedule using spaced repetition.

## Cell Types

Choose the study format that works best for you:

### Flash Card
Traditional question-and-answer format (like Anki). Perfect for:
- Vocabulary and language learning
- Definitions and concepts
- Questions with detailed answers

### Cloze Deletion
Text with hidden sections that you must fill in from memory. Great for:
- Language learning and grammar
- Definition and context-based learning
- Sentence completion exercises

**Note:** Cloze cells can have multiple groups, each generating separate review repetitions.

### True/False
Statements you evaluate as true or false. Ideal for:
- Fact-checking exercises
- Concept verification
- Quick comprehension checks

### Note
Non-reviewed text for organization and reference. Use for:
- Titles and section headers
- Supplementary information
- Context and explanations

**Note:** Notes appear in the editor but are skipped during review sessions.

## Cell Controls (Focus Tools)

When you select a cell (highlighted by a colored border), focus tools appear:

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Insert** | Add a new cell after the current one |
| **Reset** | Clear all review history for this cell and start fresh |
| **Info** | View detailed statistics about the cell's repetitions |
| **Delete** | Remove the cell and all its review data (requires confirmation) |
| **Drag** | Reorder cells by dragging them to new positions |

## Rich Text Editing

Cell content areas feature a powerful text editor with:
- **Text Formatting** — Bold, italic, underline, and more
- **Image Insertion** — Embed images directly into your cards
- **Formatting Menu** — Select text to access formatting options via a floating menu

### Cloze-Specific Formatting
When editing cloze cells, the formatting menu includes:
- **Add/Remove Cloze** — Mark or unmark text as a cloze deletion
- **Group Number Controls** — Increase or decrease the cloze group number for managing multiple deletion groups
